## Quickstart

### Requirements

- Node.js v18+
- pnpm
- Anvil (for E2E tests)

### Running the dev server

1. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).

2. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/cyfrin/localsafe.eth
  cd localsafe.eth
  pnpm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root (take `.env.example` as a reference):

```ini
  NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_project_id
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
  pnpm dev
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running E2E Tests

> **Note**: The testing infrastructure is currently in need of refactoring from Synpress. The existing tests may require updates to work with the latest changes.
<!-- 
1. Ensure you have [Anvil](https://getfoundry.sh/) installed and updated.

2. You follow the steps above to clone the repo, install dependencies, and create a `.env` file.

3. We need to install Playwright dependencies for E2E tests:

```bash
  pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps
```

4. Execute synpress once to set up its cache:

```bash
  pnpm run synpress:build # it runs anvil in the background
  # pnpm exec synpress -- you can can run it by itself too
```

_Note: you may need to start anvil in another terminal with `anvil` if you see errors about MetaMask not being able to connect to the network. After completion you can close it._

5. To run the E2E tests in headless mode (default):

```bash
  pnpm run test:e2e
```

_Note: there is a utility command `pnpm run test:clean` to clean up any wild processes (next-server, anvil) that may remain running in the background._

- Tests are written using Synpress (MetaMask automation) and Playwright.
- Test scripts are located in `tests/` and cover Safe account creation, dashboard, wallet import/export, and transaction workflows.
- The test runner script (`tests/scripts/start-anvil-and-test.sh`) starts Anvil, runs Synpress, and then Playwright tests.
- UI-based tests in the devcontainer are a work in progress; headed mode may not display correctly due to Xvfb/browser limitations.But headless tests should work fine. -->

### Run localsafe.eth with Production Build

To run the app with a production build locally and run the optimized version:

```bash
  pnpm run localsafe
```

### Deploying to IPFS

LocalSafe can be automatically deployed to IPFS via Pinata when you create a GitHub release or push a version tag. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete setup instructions.

**Quick Deploy:**
```bash
# Create and push a version tag
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0

# Or create a GitHub Release via the UI
```

The deployment workflow will:
1. Build the static site (`pnpm run build`)
2. Deploy to IPFS via Pinata
3. Output the IPFS CID and gateway URLs in the GitHub Actions logs

**Access your deployment:**
- Pinata Gateway: `https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/<CID>`
- IPFS Gateway: `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<CID>`
- Cloudflare IPFS Gateway: `https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/<CID>`

### Anvil State Management: --dump-state & --load-state

To ensure deterministic E2E tests, we use Anvil’s state management:

- After setting up contracts and accounts, run:
  ```sh
  anvil --dump-state ./anvil-safe-state.json
  ```
  This creates a snapshot of the chain state in `anvil-safe-state.json`.
- For all test runs, start Anvil with:
  ```sh
  anvil --load-state ./anvil-safe-state.json --block-time 1
  ```
  This restores the chain to the known state for reproducible tests.
- The test runner script and package.json use this approach:
  ```json
  "anvil": "anvil --load-state ./anvil-safe-state.json --block-time 1",
  "test:e2e": "bash tests/scripts/start-anvil-and-test.sh"
  ```
<!-- 
### Example: Test Runner Script

```bash
echo "[E2E] Running E2E tests with Anvil"
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Run E2E tests (Synpress and Playwright)
USE_XVFB=1
ARGS=()
for arg in "$@"; do
  if [ "$arg" == "--ui" ]; then
    USE_XVFB=0
  fi
  ARGS+=("$arg")
done

if [ "$USE_XVFB" -eq 1 ]; then
  echo "[E2E] Running in headless mode (xvfb)"
  echo "[E2E] Starting Anvil in the background..."
  echo ""
  # Start Anvil in the background
  anvil --load-state ./anvil-safe-state.json --block-time 1 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
  ANVIL_PID=$!

  trap "kill $ANVIL_PID" EXIT
  xvfb-run --auto-servernum pnpm exec synpress
  xvfb-run --auto-servernum pnpm exec playwright test "${ARGS[@]}"
else
  # You need to run anvil manually in another terminal if using --ui
  # useful if you need to restart anvil without restarting tests
  echo "[E2E] Running in UI mode (--ui)"
  echo "[E2E] Ensure Anvil is running in another terminal:"
  echo "      pnpm run anvil"
  echo ""
  pnpm exec synpress
  pnpm exec playwright test "${ARGS[@]}"
fi

```

### Example: Playwright Test (export)

```typescript
const exportBtn = page.locator('[data-testid="safe-dashboard-export-tx-btn"]');
await exportBtn.waitFor({ state: "visible" });
// Instead of waiting for download, use page.evaluate to get the exported JSON
const exportedJson = await page.evaluate(() => {
  // Expose exportTx to window for testing, or call directly if possible
  return window.exportTx && window.exportTx(window.safeAddress);
});
expect(exportedJson).toContain("expected data");
``` -->

## Developer Notes

- **Client-Side Architecture**: All wallet and Safe logic is handled client-side for maximum privacy and flexibility.
- **Hash-Based Routing**: Uses React Router with hash-based routing (`HashRouter`) to ensure compatibility with static IPFS deployments where server-side routing is not available.
- **Modular Structure**: The project structure is modular, with reusable components and hooks for maintainability.
- **WalletConnect Integration**: WalletConnect v2 is integrated for dApp connections and signing requests. Session data is persisted in localStorage.
<!-- - **E2E Testing**: Tests require manual cache management when switching environments. The testing infrastructure is currently in need of refactoring from Synpress. -->
<!-- - **Synpress Cache**: Ensure `.cache-synpress` is built for the environment you are using (devcontainer vs local). Refresh the cache by running `pnpm exec synpress --force` if you switch environments. -->
- **Process Cleanup**: Sometimes `next-server` and `anvil` processes may remain running in the background. Use `pnpm run test:clean` to kill them.
- **Local Contract Deployment**: For deploying Safe contracts locally, see the instructions below.

## Deploying Safe Contracts Locally with `safe-smart-account`

To run your own local Safe contracts for development, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account.git
   cd safe-smart-account
   ```
2. **Checkout the Correct Version**
   ```sh
   git checkout tags/v1.4.1-3
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies and Build**
   ```sh
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
4. **Start a Local Anvil Node**
   ```sh
   anvil
   ```
5. **Create a `.env` File**
   ```ini
   MNEMONIC="test test test test test test test test test test test junk"
   NODE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8545"
   ```
6. **Deploy Contracts**
   ```sh
   npx hardhat --network custom deploy
   ```
7. **Update Contract Addresses**
   - After deployment, copy the contract addresses from the output and update them in your project’s `localContractNetworks.ts` file.

> **Note:**
> Currently, contract addresses are manually maintained in `localContractNetworks.ts`. In the future, we may automate this process or use environment variables for better flexibility.
